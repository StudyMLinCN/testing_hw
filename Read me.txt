NP-CNN

Requirements:
Code is written in Python (2.7) and requires Theano.

Data Preprocessing:
The raw data can be preprocessed by one-hot or pre-trained word2vec representation.
The example takes pre-trained word2vec representation. 
Using the pre-trained `word2vec` vectors will also require downloading the binary file from
https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/

Running the example:
THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=cpu,floatX=float32 python npcnn.py % cpu for example 

Example output:
Each fold of cross-validation (cv) will output several new folders:
middle: middle results, can be ignored or deleted
results:
-- labels: the labels of each instance, 1 indicates related, 0 indicates unrelated.
-- predictions: the predicted labels of each test instance. 
-- results: the confidence of each test instance. High value indicates high possibility to be related.
